# FriendIndeed

FriendIndeed is a collaborative effort to make the world a more generous place. We attempt to do this by using social media platforms such as Facebook to connect users. Users will be able to log the good deeds and tag their friends that they helped. The simple to use interface will allow users to easily "pay it forward". We want users to be able to see the growth of their single deed in a form of a table and graph.


## Usage

In order to use FriendIndeed, a user must log in using a social media account. Then the user will be able to log the good deed who he/she did the deed for. The user should share the app's link with their friends. The person on the receiving end of the deed will be invited to sign up on the website essentially becoming another user. This person will then be allowed to write a good deed and repeat the process.
